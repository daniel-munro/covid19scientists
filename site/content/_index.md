title: COVID-19 National Scientist Volunteer Database
---
# Welcome

This is a database of over 8,000 scientists from all 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, and Guam who are eager to volunteer our time, expertise, equipment, and consumables to help you respond to the COVID-19 crisis. We have aggregated our contact information, locations, and skills sets into this easy-to-use centralized database. Our members include experts in scientific testing, bioinformatics, and data management, as well as key contacts willing to donate lab space and testing supplies.

Please spread the word to other scientists as well as the decision-makers in your city, county, and state government who can turn this database into action.

# How to gain access to the database

If you are government, university, or hospital decision-maker trying to access the database to staff testing facilities or acquire reagents, OR a local scientist organizer trying to build a team in your community, please fill out the [data access request form](https://covid19sci.org/access/).
