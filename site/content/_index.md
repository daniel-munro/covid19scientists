title: COVID-19 National Scientist Volunteer Database
---
# Welcome

We have curated a database of scientists from all 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, and Guam who are eager to volunteer our time, expertise, equipment, and consumables to help YOU respond to the COVID-19 crisis. Our members include experts in scientific testing, bioinformatics, and data management, as well as key contacts willing to donate lab space and testing supplies.

Our team has aggregated our membership contact information, location, and skill sets into this easy-to-use centralized database. A preview of the database with contact information redacted can be found [here](/public-db).

Help spread the word to other scientists as well as the decision-makers in your city, county, and state government who can turn this database into action!
