title: COVID-19 National Scientist Volunteer Database
---
# Welcome

This is a database of  9,000 scientists from all 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, and Guam who are eager to volunteer our time, expertise, equipment, and consumables to help you respond to the COVID-19 crisis. We have aggregated our contact information, locations, and skills sets into this easy-to-use centralized database. Our members include experts in scientific testing, bioinformatics, and data management, as well as key contacts willing to donate lab space and testing supplies. A preview of the database with contact information redacted can be found [here](https://covid19sci.org/public-db/).

Please spread the word to other scientists as well as the decision-makers in your city, county, and state government who can turn this database into action.
