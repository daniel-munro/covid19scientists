  date: 2020-08-26
  description: This is what democracy looks like. The recent civil rights protests that held the news cycle for a couple of weeks never stopped; given recent events, these protests are obviously still necessary. In light of the COVID-19 viral pandemic, we have gathered a list of best practices for Pandemic Protesting.

  title: "Meet a Volunteer:<br>Payal Maharaj"
  date: 2020-08-12
  description: Payal strongly feels that everyone can contribute in some manner towards the resolution of this pandemic and she is happy to do her part. In part because she thinks it is a great idea to bring scientific minds together in order to combat this virus, NSVD seemed to her like the ultimate scientific collaboration for a great cause and signed up immediately.

  title: "Meet a Scientist:<br>Shannon Kozlovich"
  date: 2020-06-18
  description: She took it upon herself to be the Volunteer Communications Coordinator for the 9000+ strong volunteer databaseâ€”that continues to grow each day! She took this volunteer position because "it leverages my pre-academic skills, my scientific knowledge, and training, as well as my ability to communicate with policy-makers."

  date: 2020-06-08
  description: COVID-19 has highlighted shortcomings in our data infrastructure and data quality - from the project level to the global level. I was on the lookout for projects that could benefit from getting started on the right foot along those lines when NSVD came along.

  title: The Origin Story
  date: 2020-05-09
  description: The database came into existence with a bang! We had 1,000 scientists sign up on the first day, and 4,000 had signed up by the end of the first week. At that point, we had to get practical.
